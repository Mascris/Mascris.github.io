## 🎨 Design Philosophy
                          
This portfolio deviates from standard flat designs by utilizing a **"Deep Space"** theme. It focuses on depth, lighting, and texture to create a premium feel.

*   **Visuals:** Dark violet/midnight blue background with a subtle grid overlay and ambient glow.
*   **UI Style:** **Glassmorphism** (frosted glass effect) for cards and navigation.
*   **Typography:** 'Space Grotesk' for headings (tech feel) and 'Inter' for body text (readability).
*   **Interactivity:** Typing effects, hover states, and scroll-triggered reveal animations.

## 🛠️ Features

*   ✅ **Fully Responsive:** Looks perfect on Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop.
*   ✅ **Zero Dependencies:** Built with 100% pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No frameworks required.
*   ✅ **Performance:** Scores 95+ on Lighthouse due to lightweight code.
*   ✅ **Dynamic Hero Section:** Includes an auto-typing text effect.
*   ✅ **Professional Footer:** Multi-column layout with social links.
